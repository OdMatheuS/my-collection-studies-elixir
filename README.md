# Studying Elixir

A simple repo to add Elixir studies.

## Material/Code

At this moment I will add content using livebook, which is very practical and very fun to use.

In case you don't know the livebook, in the references I added the official repo, all very detailed to install.

Let's spread functional programming to the world :)
